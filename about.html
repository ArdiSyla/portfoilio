            Hello! My name is Ardi, and I enjoy creating things that live on the internet. 
            My interest in web development started back in 2018 when I made my first web page about a football team I support.
            That experience taught me a lot about HTML and CSS!
        </p>        
          <p class="about-text">
            Fast-forward to today, and I've learned more about web development. I have learned stacks like the MERN Stack and 
            about Content Management Systems like WordPress, as well as mobile development with React Native.
            My main focus these days is building accessible, inclusive products and 
            digital experiences for a variety of clients.
